# Explaination:
# We are using a linked list as block chain and a hashmap 
# as storage for hash-block pairs, so that we'll find a block
# with its hash for O(1) time complexity.
# And the time complexity for each actions in linked list are:
# Prepend: O(1)
# Append: O(n)
# Search: O(n)
# Pop: O(1)
# Remove: O(n)
# Insert: O(n)
# Size: O(n)
# The space complexity is O(n + n) = O(n)
