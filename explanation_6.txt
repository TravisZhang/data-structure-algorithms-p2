# Explaination:
# We want to record each element's appearance, so we best use dict()
# to store it. When finding union, we need to find all the elemnets
# that appeared at least once. When finding intersection, we need to
# find element that both appeared in list1 and list2.
# The time complexities are:
# Union: O(n), since we are going through elements of the two lists at the same time
# Intersection: O(n), since we first go through list1, then go through list2
# The space complexity for both is O(n)
