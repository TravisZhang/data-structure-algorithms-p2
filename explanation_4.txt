# Explanation:
# It's very similar to the File Recursion one, which you have to 
# implement a recursive function to reach the deepest node. So the
# time complexity is also O(n*m), since you have n groups, and each
# group has m sub groups and users, and in worst case scenario, 
# you have to traverse all the groups and their sub elements 
# to find out if the user exists in those elements.
# And the space compleity is also O(n*m) for storing the above elements
# while finding the user.
